# Mission-to-Mars
The ability to use web-scraping tools with HTML and CSS provided a new level of programming.

## Project Tools
- Chrome Inspect to help find HTML elements
- HTML elements such as class and id to help identify data for scraping
- BeautifulSoup and Splinter to perform a web scrape
- MongoDB to store the unordered data using collections
- Flask to display scraped data
- Bootstrap to polish the web content 

## Project Work
In this project, data was scraped from a website using HTML parsing, HTML tags and storage in MongoDB. Then the scraped data was displayed by using Flask. Bootstrap was used to help make the website attractive.

## Project Summary
The final results was a rudimentary website that given more time could have been made presentable.
